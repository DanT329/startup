Here we have a rough mockup of what the main page might look like while reviewing profiles. I may add a functionality to write a short description of yourself later. You can see other users can leave you a rating after a workout:

### Technologies

**Use of Technologies:**
- **HTML** - I will have three HTML pages. One for login, one for viewing profiles, and one for interacting with a match.
- **CSS** - Styling the application in a clean and user-friendly way. No overuse of contrasting colors or flashy visuals.
- **Javascript** - Login support, selecting profiles, display user ratings.
- **Service** - Backend service endpoint:
  - login
  - retrieving profiles
  - submitting match select
  - retrieving match status
  - sending/retrieving messages
- **DataBase** - Store user profiles, matches, and messages.
- **Login** - Log in and create profile. Profile needed to view or interact with other users.
- **WebSocket** - Generate real-time reviews and send chat between users.
- **React** - Application to follow framework.

### HTML Deliverable
- **HTML Pages** -- Added four HTML pages that allow account creation, login, viewing other users, and messaging.
- **Links** -- Account creation button and login button both directly link to the user page. Nav menue present throughout all pages.
- **Textual Content** -- Profiles are described by textual content. All buttons and links are described as well.
- **3rd Party Service Calls** -- Added a placeholder for directly searching Google Maps for near by gyms on the homepage. May later update to include trails or other outdoor activities.
- **Application Images** -- Added a placeholder image for profiles on the messaging page. Not a lot of images will be present on the actual page.
- **Login** -- Created a login page and a account creation page. User name displayed at top of each page other than account creation.
- **Database** -- User page is a placeholder for all account information storage and viewing. Message page also stores information.
- **Websocket** -- Real time updates will be displayed on the Message page, allowing users to communicate with one another.
- **Git Commits** -- Every major update is documented upon commit.

### JavaScript Deliverable
- **Future Login** -- Created a function to check login information. Currently Username is set to: Username and Password is set to: Password. If an inccorect password or username is used an alert will display.
- **Account Creation** -- Home  page allows user to create an account. Information is currently stored in local. Updates username throughout page.
- **Javascript Databases**
  - ***Users Database*** -- On users.html user profiles are generated from an array that holds all  user data. Currently it is stored as local data and is preset. Each time a new user is created at index.html another user will be added to the array. For demonstration purposes it is possible for the current user to interact with their own profile card under users.html. The current users profile will not be visable to themsevles after production is complete.
  - ***Messaging Database*** -- A message card is generated from the user array based on the last profile clicked on. Messages are stored locally and will currently reset on page refresh.
- **Websocket Support** -- Everything is currently stored local but is ready to both send and recieve information from the server.
  - ***Messaging*** -- Users should be able to send and recieve messages. Currently you can only send the message since there is no input from another user to respond. Message is kept in local storage for now.
  - ***Google Maps*** -- For now, integration with Google Maps is on hold. I need to figure out JavaScript API keys from Google. It should be free if the requests are less than a certain amount each month but I want to be sure before committing to creating an account. I'm poor and can't afford to pay Google for using their maps ðŸ˜¢
- **JavaScript Logic** -- Everything seems to work well so far. All the correct pages load on click and the proper functions retrieve and store data.
- **Git Commits** -- Every major update has a commit.
### Services Deliverable
- **HTTP Services Using Node.js** -- Created an index.js page using Express that handles all fetch requests to my page. The public folder is used to generate the application.
-**Static Middleware** -- Express static middleware used to serve up frontend.
-**Third Party Service Call** -- If you navigate to the "Login" page you will find a button that will make a call from boredapi.com and display a suggested activity. To find the "Login" page you must be on the "Home Page". Above account creation, you click "Already Have An Account? Login".
-**BackEnd Service Endpoints** -- The back end has several endpoints that can be called.
  - ***Users Data*** -- All users upon account creation are stored in an array of information. There is both a POST and GET endpoint.
  - ***Messages Data*** -- Messages are stored in "conversations = {}". GET and POST allow manipulation of data. A key is assigned to each message chain within POST endpoint.
  - ***Workouts Data*** -- A GET and POST endpoint is provided for both posting workouts and getting workouts.  The ability to vote on the best workouts is also provided in a separate endpoint.
- ***Frontend Calls Endpoints*** -- Several fetch requests are made on the frontend.
  - ***Users Data*** -- On account creation a POST is made to api/userdata. The user is then taken to the users.html page where a GET request is made for api/userdata. All current users saved on the server are then displayed. For demo purposes, the first account you create will use local storage to save your account. You will also be able to see your own account under users.  This will change after a login system is created. For now, if you would like to test messaging between two users do the following: 1) Create your first account. 2) Open a private browser and create a second account. 3) Message from either one. 4) Click "Update Messages" to see responses. You can also click the bottom buttons to navigate between different conversations.   
  - ***Messages Data*** -- The front end makes two calls to the GET endpoint of api/conversations. Then each time a message is sent it will make a POST to the endpoint of api/conversations. The data is bounced back and forth. Without web sockets, you need to reload the page to update your messages. This allows users to have messaging functionality.
  - ***Workouts Data*** -- The front end will make a GET request to the server to display all current workouts on the server. A POST is made to upload a workout. A POST and GET are made at the same time to update user voting.
- **Git Commits** -- Several git commits are made. I tried to make them descriptive.
- **Some Notes** -- Deleted the Google Maps api call(didn't want to pay for it). Added a "Workouts" page in case messaging gets too complicated in the future and I need to remove it but still have a usable application. Once account authentication is implemented it will lock pages from access. For now, you can browse without having an account and cause some interesting errors if you so choose. All users also have static ratings since it became to complicated to rate users at the moment. I also removed profile photos to save on storage.

### DataBase Deliverable
- **Mongo Atlas DB Created** -- Databse created.
- **Endpoints** -- All relevant endpoints have been changed to interact with the database and not just data stored on the server.
  - ***Work Out Plans*** -- I didn't include the workouts on my database since I will most likely be deleting this functionality. It was only meant to serve as a backup in case I couldn't get messaging working.
  - ***Messages*** -- You still need to click update messages in order to get message chains. I could implement a function to ping the server every few seconds but web sockets will hopefully remove the need to do that.
  - ***Users*** -- All user profiles are now saved on the database.
- **Store Application Data** - Information is stored in the database cluster.
- **Git Commits** -- Git commits document updates.
### Login Deliverable
- **New User Registration** -- New users are created and stored on the Mongo DB. Passwords are hashed and tokens are stored on the browser until the user clicks logout. 
- **Existing User Authentication** -- You can use the login page to access your account or store user tokens in the cookies. I did remove nav links outside of the main pages so if you close the browser without logging out or clearing cookies you can still manually access the page but I limited functionality so you'd have to go through the login page again. Later I may add something to reroute the user if a token is found, but for now, I prefer it this way.
- **Stores and Retrieves Credentials** -- All passwords are hashed and stored in user accounts. Tokens are stored as well. When logging in a username and password hash are compared before retrieving credentials.
- **Restricts Application Functionality** -- All secure api routes are blocked from unauthorized access. The user page will automatically redirect to login if no token is found. The user page will also not be able to retrieve users from the database. Message chains are also blocked from access. I left workouts open to public access but mostly because I will be removing it in the future pending web sockets working with my messaging setup.
- **Multiple Git Commits** -- Most major changes have a git commit. There were a few changes committed all at once due to an error that prevented me from pushing updates during the development of some sections.
### WebSocket Deliverable
- **Backend Listens** - Backend listens for any user that connects to or creates a WebSocket. test_peerProxy.js uses an io socket to listen for a connection. It also will listen for any connections to active chatrooms and direct traffic as needed. If a chatroom is empty, the socket will be closed.
- **Frontend Makes Websocket Connection** - Frontend uses test_message.js to open a WebSocket to a new chat room or will connect to an active WebSocket that is currently in use. The front end allows the user to select from a list of active rooms or make their own.
- **Data Sent Through Websocket** - The front sends a user object over the WebSocket to be processed by the server. It also sends messages submitted by the user. The front end will also listen for any incoming traffic from the server. The server will emit a list of active chat rooms and also emit a list of users in each of the active rooms. The user list is only sent to users in those rooms. Using an io socket I was able to create several WebSockets at once using the same server as opposed to just ws.
- **Git Commits** - All relevant changes were commented on and committed.
- **Additional Notes** - I changed the private messaging(messages.js) to work with polling instead of websockets. This worked better with my current infrastructure created over the course of the semester. After several hours of attempting a total conversion with private messaging, it became apparent I would need much more knowledge on sockets than I currently have. Instead in order to implement WebSockets on my application, I created a new page called "Public Chat" that allows users to create their own chatrooms and have others join. Using io sockets the users can now create their own room or join an active room. If you would like to test functionality, I reccomened creating two or more profiles and experimenting with "Public Chat."
### React Deliverable
- **Bundled Using Babel and WebPack** - Done!
- **React Components** - All pages were converted over to React components. The only one I couldn't get working was my public chat rooms with socket.io. Despite configuring Vite and some other attempted fixes, I kept getting a CORS block. Part of the issue was most likely how I had my WebSocket server set up. Other than that, all pages are now React components!
- **React Router** - Routing is used between all components to render the appropriate selection.
- **React Hooks** - Hooks are used throughout in order to update states and pass information between components as needed.
- **Git Commits** - All changes documented through commits.
